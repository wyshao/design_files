The design files for the paper submission "Experimental Demonstration of Millimeter-Wave Self-Bending Over-Obstacle Focused Beam Using Single Phase-Modulated 3-D Printed Dielectric Plate Structure" 

Specifically, 
1."3-D dielectric plate model.stl" 
3-D model file (.stl) of proposed phase-modulated plate with diameter of 153 mm in Section II(B).
It consists of 51 x 51 dielectric solid boxes with different heights. The uit-cell of dielectric solid box has a length and width of 3 mm.

2."height values of proposed dielectric plate.xlsx"   
Specific height values (units: mm) of designed phase-modulated plate in Section II(B). 

Usage:
1."3-D dielectric plate model.stl" To open this file, the common 3-D model designing software is required. 
If you import this 3-D model file into full-wave simulation software such as CSTMWS OR HFSS, don't forget to set the values of dielectric constant (2.75) for imported structure.
